## How does a workflow to create documentation with Sphinx and readthedocs.org look like?

Here is a basic workflow for creating documentation with Sphinx and hosting it on readthedocs.org:

1. Install Sphinx: Sphinx is a Python package that can be installed using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: pip install sphinx.
2. Initialize Sphinx: In your project directory, initialize Sphinx by running the following command: sphinx-quickstart. This will create a docs/ directory with some default files and configurations.
3. Write documentation: In the docs/ directory, create .rst files for each section of the documentation. Use Sphinx-specific directives and syntax to add tables, code blocks, and other elements to the documentation.
4. Build documentation: Use the sphinx-build command to build the documentation. Run the following command from the docs/ directory: sphinx-build -b html . \_build/html. This will create HTML files in the \_build/html/ directory.
5. Host documentation on readthedocs.org: Create an account on readthedocs.org and connect it to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository. Configure the documentation settings on readthedocs.org to point to the docs/ directory and the branch that you want to use for documentation.
6. Configure webhook: In your repository's settings on GitHub or Bitbucket, configure a webhook to trigger a build on readthedocs.org whenever changes are pushed to the documentation branch.
7. Update documentation: Whenever you make changes to the documentation, commit and push the changes to the documentation branch. The webhook will trigger a build on readthedocs.org, which will update the hosted documentation.
8. View documentation: View the hosted documentation on readthedocs.org. The documentation will be automatically updated whenever changes are pushed to the documentation branch.

This workflow is a basic overview of how to create documentation with Sphinx and host it on readthedocs.org. There are many additional configuration options and features available with Sphinx and readthedocs.org, so be sure to refer to the official documentation for more information.
