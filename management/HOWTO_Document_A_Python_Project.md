# ChatGPT - Python Project Documentation

## How should a module structured concerning good documentation?

A well-documented module should contain the following elements:

1. Docstring: A docstring is a string literal that describes what the module does. It should be the first statement in the module file, and it should be enclosed in triple quotes ("""docstring"""). The docstring should provide an overview of the module's purpose, functionality, and usage.
2. Imports: The module should import any necessary dependencies at the top of the file. Each import statement should be on a separate line.
3. Constants: If the module defines any constants or global variables, they should be defined near the top of the file, after the imports.
4. Functions and classes: The main functionality of the module should be implemented as functions or classes. Each function or class should be well-documented with docstrings that describe its purpose, parameters, return value, and any exceptions that it may raise.
5. Example usage: The module should provide one or more examples of how to use its functions or classes. This can be done in a separate "Examples" section or in the docstrings for individual functions or classes.
6. Exceptions: If the module defines any exceptions, they should be documented with docstrings that describe when they are raised and how to handle them.
7. Private functions and classes: If the module defines any private functions or classes (i.e., functions or classes that are not intended to be used outside the module), they should be documented as such with a leading underscore (\_) in their names.
8. Other considerations: The module should be well-organized, with related functions and classes grouped together. It should follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, with clear and consistent naming conventions and formatting.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-documented module that is easy to understand and use. It is also recommended to use a documentation generator such as Sphinx or MkDocs to automatically generate documentation from your docstrings and other metadata.

## Is writing documentation in ReStructuredText "rst" required or is it also possible to use Github-flavored markdown?

It depends on the tools and frameworks that you are using. ReStructuredText (rst) is a markup language that is commonly used for writing documentation in Python projects, especially those that use the Sphinx documentation generator.

Sphinx is a tool that generates documentation from rst files, and it provides many features and extensions that are specifically designed for rst syntax. Therefore, if you are using Sphinx to generate documentation for your Python project, it is recommended to write documentation in rst syntax.

However, if you are not using Sphinx and you prefer to use GitHub-flavored markdown, you can still write documentation using markdown syntax. There are many tools and frameworks that support markdown syntax for documentation, such as MkDocs, which is a popular static site generator for documentation.

In summary, it is not required to use rst syntax for documentation, but it is recommended if you are using Sphinx. If you are not using Sphinx and prefer to use markdown syntax, you can do so with other tools and frameworks that support markdown.

## How does a workflow to create documentation with Sphinx and readthedocs.org look like?

Here is a basic workflow for creating documentation with Sphinx and hosting it on readthedocs.org:

1. Install Sphinx: Sphinx is a Python package that can be installed using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: pip install sphinx.
2. Initialize Sphinx: In your project directory, initialize Sphinx by running the following command: sphinx-quickstart. This will create a docs/ directory with some default files and configurations.
3. Write documentation: In the docs/ directory, create .rst files for each section of the documentation. Use Sphinx-specific directives and syntax to add tables, code blocks, and other elements to the documentation.
4. Build documentation: Use the sphinx-build command to build the documentation. Run the following command from the docs/ directory: sphinx-build -b html . \_build/html. This will create HTML files in the \_build/html/ directory.
5. Host documentation on readthedocs.org: Create an account on readthedocs.org and connect it to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository. Configure the documentation settings on readthedocs.org to point to the docs/ directory and the branch that you want to use for documentation.
6. Configure webhook: In your repository's settings on GitHub or Bitbucket, configure a webhook to trigger a build on readthedocs.org whenever changes are pushed to the documentation branch.
7. Update documentation: Whenever you make changes to the documentation, commit and push the changes to the documentation branch. The webhook will trigger a build on readthedocs.org, which will update the hosted documentation.
8. View documentation: View the hosted documentation on readthedocs.org. The documentation will be automatically updated whenever changes are pushed to the documentation branch.

This workflow is a basic overview of how to create documentation with Sphinx and host it on readthedocs.org. There are many additional configuration options and features available with Sphinx and readthedocs.org, so be sure to refer to the official documentation for more information.

## What would a workflow look like if I use Github-flavored markdown, MkDocs and readthedocs.org?

Here is a basic workflow for creating documentation with MkDocs and hosting it on readthedocs.org:

1. Install MkDocs: MkDocs is a Python package that can be installed using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command: pip install mkdocs.
2. Initialize MkDocs: In your project directory, initialize MkDocs by running the following command: mkdocs new docs. This will create a docs/ directory with some default files and configurations.
3. Write documentation: In the docs/ directory, create .md files for each section of the documentation. Use GitHub-flavored markdown syntax to add tables, code blocks, and other elements to the documentation.
4. Build documentation: Use the mkdocs build command to build the documentation. Run the following command from the project directory: mkdocs build. This will create HTML files in the site/ directory.
5. Host documentation on readthedocs.org: Create an account on readthedocs.org and connect it to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository. Configure the documentation settings on readthedocs.org to point to the site/ directory and the branch that you want to use for documentation.
6. Configure webhook: In your repository's settings on GitHub or Bitbucket, configure a webhook to trigger a build on readthedocs.org whenever changes are pushed to the documentation branch.
7. Update documentation: Whenever you make changes to the documentation, commit and push the changes to the documentation branch. The webhook will trigger a build on readthedocs.org, which will update the hosted documentation.
8. View documentation: View the hosted documentation on readthedocs.org. The documentation will be automatically updated whenever changes are pushed to the documentation branch.

This workflow is a basic overview of how to create documentation with MkDocs and host it on readthedocs.org. There are many additional configuration options and features available with MkDocs and readthedocs.org, so be sure to refer to the official documentation for more information.

## How do I need to call sphinx-quickstart to create the basis for documentation in markdown?

To create the basis for documentation in markdown using sphinx-quickstart, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Sphinx documentation.

2. Run the sphinx-quickstart command to start the quickstart process:

```bash
sphinx-quickstart
```

3. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions to configure your Sphinx project. Here are some recommended settings for creating documentation in markdown:

	1. Separate source and build directories (y/n) - Answer y to create separate directories for your source files and generated documentation.
	2. Name prefix for templates and static dir - Leave this blank to use the default value.
	3. Project name - Enter the name of your project.
	4. Author name(s) - Enter your name and any other authors.
	5. Project release [] - Leave this blank for now.
	6. Project language [en] - Enter the language of your documentation, if different from English.
	7. Source file suffix [.rst] - Change this to .md to use markdown files for your source files.
	8. Name of your master document (without suffix) - Change this to index to use a markdown file named index.md as your main documentation file.
	9. Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) - Answer n if you don't need to generate epub files.
	10. autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) - Answer n if you don't need to generate documentation from your code.
	11. Do you want to document a project with multiple versions (y/n) - Answer n for now.
	12. Do you want to configure setup.py with your project's information (y/n) - Answer n for now.
4. Once you have answered all the questions, Sphinx will generate a set of files and directories for your documentation, including a conf.py file and a index.md file in the source directory.
5. Edit the conf.py file as necessary to configure your Sphinx project, including setting the extensions list and other settings specific to your documentation.
6. Edit the index.md file and other markdown files as necessary to create your documentation.
7. To generate HTML documentation from your markdown files, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html sourcedir builddir
```

Replace sourcedir with the path to your source directory (usually named source), and builddir with the path to your build directory (usually named build).
8. This will generate HTML documentation from your markdown files and place the output files in the build directory. You can view the generated documentation by opening the index.html file in your web browser.

## What do I need to do to created Sphinx documentation from my Python modules which contain documentation in GoogleStyle format?

To create Sphinx documentation from your Python modules which contain documentation in GoogleStyle format, you need to follow these general steps:

1. Install Sphinx and the sphinxcontrib-napoleon extension using pip:

```bash
pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-napoleon
```

2. Create a Sphinx documentation project:

```bash
sphinx-quickstart
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project.

3. Add your Python module directory to the sys.path in the Sphinx conf.py file:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/your/module')
```

4. In the Sphinx conf.py file, configure the autodoc extension to generate documentation from your Python modules:

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
]

autodoc_member_order = 'bysource'
```

5. Run the Sphinx apidoc command to generate a .rst file for your Python module:

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o /path/to/docs/source /path/to/your/module
```

This will create a .rst file in your Sphinx source directory, which you can edit to include additional documentation and formatting.

6. Generate the Sphinx documentation by running:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html /path/to/docs/source /path/to/docs/build
```

This will create HTML documentation from your .rst files in the Sphinx build directory.

You can then open the index.html file in your web browser to view the documentation.

Note that these steps provide a basic outline for creating Sphinx documentation from Python modules with GoogleStyle documentation. Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to adjust the configuration or add additional steps to customize your documentation.

## Can you give me an outline of a Python file concerning good documentation including a shebang and character set used as well as identification for author and module creation?

Yes, here is an outline of a Python file with good documentation that includes a shebang and character set, identification for author and module creation, and other important elements:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
Short description of the module

Longer description of the module, including details on its purpose and functionality.

Author: Your Name
Email: your.email@example.com
Date: 2023-03-05
"""

# Imports
import os
import sys

# Constants
CONSTANT_ONE = 1
CONSTANT_TWO = 2

# Functions
def my_function(param_one, param_two):
    """
    Short description of the function.

    Longer description of the function, including details on its purpose, parameters,
    return value, and any exceptions that it may raise.

    Args:
        param_one (type): Description of param_one.
        param_two (type): Description of param_two.

    Returns:
        type: Description of return value.

    Raises:
        ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised.

    Example:
        Example usage of the function.
    """
    # Function body

# Classes
class MyClass:
    """
    Short description of the class.

    Longer description of the class, including details on its purpose, attributes,
    methods, and any exceptions that it may raise.

    Attributes:
        attribute_one (type): Description of attribute_one.
        attribute_two (type): Description of attribute_two.

    Example:
        Example usage of the class.
    """
    # Class body

# Other considerations
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Script body
```

This Python file includes the following elements:

1. Shebang: The shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env python) is the first line of the file and tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the script.
2. Character set: The character set declaration (# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-) tells Python which character set to use for the source code.
3. Docstring: The docstring is a string literal that provides an overview of the module, including its purpose and functionality.
4. Author and module creation: The author, email, and creation date are included in the docstring to identify the author and creation date of the module.
5. Imports: The module imports any necessary dependencies at the top of the file.
6. Constants: The module defines any constants or global variables near the top of the file, after the imports.
7. Functions and classes: The main functionality of the module is implemented as functions or classes, each with a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, return value, and any exceptions that it may raise.
8. Example usage: The module provides one or more examples of how to use its functions or classes.
9. Other considerations: The module follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, with clear and consistent naming conventions and formatting. The script body is included in the if \_\_name__ == '\_\_main__' block to ensure that it is only executed when the script is run directly and not when it is imported as a module.

## I previously saw code with an "@" before the lines. What would that be useful for?
Author: Your Name
Email: your.email@example.com
Date: 2023-03-05

The "@" symbol before the lines in the code that you saw indicates that they are part of a docstring that uses the reStructuredText (rst) syntax. In rst syntax, the "@" symbol is used to indicate that a line is a field list item. Field lists are used to define structured metadata within a docstring, such as author information, version numbers, or other metadata relevant to the module or function.

Here is an example of how the "@" symbol can be used to define a field list in a docstring:

```python
"""
Short description of the module.

:author: Your Name
:email: your.email@example.com
:date: 2023-03-05
"""
```

In this example, the field list items :author:, :email:, and :date: are used to define author information, email address, and the creation date of the module. The use of field lists in rst syntax can help to make docstrings more structured and easier to read.

## How would that look like if I use Github-flavored markdown, MkDocs and readthedocs.org?

In Github-flavored markdown, you can include metadata such as author and date information directly in the body of the markdown document. Here is an example of what that might look like:

```python
# Module Name

Short description of the module.

**Author:** Your Name  
**Email:** your.email@example.com  
**Date:** 2023-03-05

## Function One

Short description of function one.

### Parameters

- `param_one`: Description of param_one.
- `param_two`: Description of param_two.

### Returns

Description of return value.

### Raises

- `ExceptionType`: Description of when this exception is raised.

### Example

Example usage of the function.

## Class One

Short description of class one.

### Attributes

- `attribute_one`: Description of attribute_one.
- `attribute_two`: Description of attribute_two.

### Example

Example usage of the class.
```

In this example, the author, email, and date information are included in the body of the markdown document, separated by double asterisks (**). Each function or class is separated by a level 2 heading (##) or a level 3 heading (###), and the function or class name is included in the heading. The parameters, return value, and exceptions for each function are described in separate subsections, and an example usage is included. Similarly, the attributes of each class are described in a subsection, and an example usage is included.

To generate documentation from this markdown file using MkDocs, you would create a mkdocs.yml configuration file that points to the markdown file and any necessary dependencies. Once you have configured MkDocs, you can use the mkdocs build command to generate HTML documentation from the markdown file. You can then host the documentation on readthedocs.org by creating an account and connecting it to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository, as described in the previous answer.

## How would that look like in Python code?

In Python code, you can include metadata such as author and date information in the module docstring using reStructuredText (rst) syntax. Here is an example of what that might look like:

```python
"""
Module Name

Short description of the module.

:author: Your Name
:email: your.email@example.com
:date: 2023-03-05
"""

def function_one(param_one, param_two):
    """
    Function One

    Short description of function one.

    :param param_one: Description of param_one.
    :type param_one: type
    :param param_two: Description of param_two.
    :type param_two: type
    :return: Description of return value.
    :raises ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised.
    :example: Example usage of the function.
    """
    # Function body

class ClassOne:
    """
    Class One

    Short description of class one.

    :param attribute_one: Description of attribute_one.
    :type attribute_one: type
    :param attribute_two: Description of attribute_two.
    :type attribute_two: type
    :example: Example usage of the class.
    """
    # Class body
```

In this example, the author, email, and date information are included in the module docstring using field list items (:author:, :email:, and :date:). Each function or class is defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, return value, and any exceptions that it may raise. Each parameter is described using the :param: and :type: field list items, and the return value is described using the :return: field list item. Exceptions are described using the :raises: field list item, and an example usage is included using the :example: field list item.

To generate documentation from this Python file using Sphinx, you would create a conf.py configuration file that points to the Python file and any necessary dependencies. Once you have configured Sphinx, you can use the make html command to generate HTML documentation from the Python file. You can then host the documentation on readthedocs.org by creating an account and connecting it to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository, as described in the previous answer.

## How would this Python file look like using Github-flavored markdown?

In Python code, you can include metadata such as author and date information in the module docstring using reStructuredText (rst) syntax or using Github-flavored markdown. Here is an example of what the same module might look like using Github-flavored markdown:

```python
# Module Name

Short description of the module.

**Author:** Your Name  
**Email:** your.email@example.com  
**Date:** 2023-03-05

## Function One

Short description of function one.

### Parameters

- `param_one`: Description of param_one.
- `param_two`: Description of param_two.

### Returns

Description of return value.

### Raises

- `ExceptionType`: Description of when this exception is raised.

### Example

Example usage of the function.

## Class One

Short description of class one.

### Attributes

- `attribute_one`: Description of attribute_one.
- `attribute_two`: Description of attribute_two.

### Example

Example usage of the class.
```

In this example, the author, email, and date information are included as a series of bullet points using double asterisks (\*\*). Each function or class is defined with a level 2 heading (##) or a level 3 heading (###), and the function or class name is included in the heading. The parameters, return value, and exceptions for each function are described in separate subsections, and an example usage is included. Similarly, the attributes of each class are described in a subsection, and an example usage is included.

To generate documentation from this markdown file using MkDocs, you would create a mkdocs.yml configuration file that points to the markdown file and any necessary dependencies. Once you have configured MkDocs, you can use the mkdocs build command to generate HTML documentation from the markdown file. You can then host the documentation on readthedocs.org by creating an account and connecting it to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository, as described in the previous answer.

## Can you give me the last as Python code using Github-flavored markdown?

In Python code, you can include metadata such as author and date information in the module docstring using reStructuredText (rst) syntax or using Github-flavored markdown. Here is an example of what the same module might look like using Github-flavored markdown:

```python
"""
# Module Name

Short description of the module.

**Author:** Your Name  
**Email:** your.email@example.com  
**Date:** 2023-03-05

## Function One

Short description of function one.

### Parameters

- `param_one`: Description of param_one.
- `param_two`: Description of param_two.

### Returns

Description of return value.

### Raises

- `ExceptionType`: Description of when this exception is raised.

### Example

Example usage of the function.

## Class One

Short description of class one.

### Attributes

- `attribute_one`: Description of attribute_one.
- `attribute_two`: Description of attribute_two.

### Example

Example usage of the class.
"""

def function_one(param_one, param_two):
    """
    Short description of function one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param_one : type
        Description of param_one.
    param_two : type
        Description of param_two.

    Returns
    -------
    type
        Description of return value.

    Raises
    ------
    ExceptionType
        Description of when this exception is raised.

    Example
    -------
    Example usage of the function.
    """
    # Function body

class ClassOne:

    Short description of class one.

    Attributes
    ----------

    attribute_two : type
        Description of attribute_two.

    Example
    -------
    Example usage of the class.
    """
    # Class body
```

In this example, the module docstring uses markdown syntax instead of rst syntax to include the author, email, and date information as bullet points using double asterisks (\*\*). Each function or class is defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, return value, and any exceptions that it may raise. Parameters are described using the : syntax, and the return value and exceptions are described using standard docstring syntax. Examples are included using the Example section. The attributes of each class are described in a separate section, and an example usage is included.

To generate documentation from this Python file using Sphinx and readthedocs.org, you would follow the same process as outlined in the previous answer, but with different configuration files and settings specific to Sphinx and readthedocs.org.

## If I want to use GoogleStyle documenation and markdown. How would that look like?

GoogleStyle documentation and markdown are two different styles of documentation, so it is not possible to use them together in a single docstring or document. However, you can use the GoogleStyle documentation conventions in a docstring and write the documentation in markdown syntax. Here is an example of what that might look like:

```python
"""
Module Name

Short description of the module.

Author: Your Name
Email: your.email@example.com
Date: 2023-03-05

Example:
    ```
    example code here
    ```

See Also:
    * `related documentation <https://example.com>`_
"""

def function_one(param_one: type, param_two: type) -> type:
    """
    Short description of function one.

    Args:
        param_one: Description of param_one.
        param_two: Description of param_two.

    Returns:
        Description of return value.

    Raises:
        ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised.

    Example:
        Example usage of the function.

    See Also:
        * `related documentation <https://example.com>`_
    """
    # Function body
```

In this example, the module docstring includes the author, email, and date information using the GoogleStyle conventions, and the documentation for the function uses the same conventions. The docstring is written in markdown syntax, but uses the Args, Returns, Raises, Example, and See Also sections from the GoogleStyle conventions. URLs are linked using the <> syntax, and the See Also section uses the * syntax to create a bullet point list.

To generate documentation from this Python file using Sphinx and readthedocs.org, you would follow the same process as outlined in the previous answers, but with different configuration files and settings specific to Sphinx and readthedocs.org.

## Can you add an example for a class as you did with the function example?

Certainly! Here is an example of a class with a docstring using GoogleStyle conventions and markdown syntax:

```python
"""
Class Name

Short description of the class.

Author: Your Name
Email: your.email@example.com
Date: 2023-03-05

Example:
    ```
    example code here
    ```

See Also:
    * `related documentation <https://example.com>`_
"""

class ClassName:
    """
    Short description of the class.

    Attributes:
        attribute_one: Description of attribute_one.
        attribute_two: Description of attribute_two.

    Example:
        Example usage of the class.

    See Also:
        * `related documentation <https://example.com>`_
    """

    def __init__(self, attribute_one: type, attribute_two: type):
        """
        Short description of the constructor.

        Args:
            attribute_one: Description of attribute_one.
            attribute_two: Description of attribute_two.
        """
        # Constructor body

    def method_one(self, param_one: type, param_two: type) -> type:
        """
        Short description of method one.

        Args:
            param_one: Description of param_one.
            param_two: Description of param_two.

        Returns:
            Description of return value.

        Raises:
            ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised.

        Example:
            Example usage of the method.

        See Also:
            * `related documentation <https://example.com>`_
        """
        # Method body
```

In this example, the docstring for the class and the constructor use the same conventions as the function docstring, with the addition of an Attributes section to describe the attributes of the class. The method docstring uses the same conventions, but includes an additional self parameter in the Args section to indicate that the method is a member of the class.

To generate documentation from this Python file using Sphinx and readthedocs.org, you would follow the same process as outlined in the previous answers, but with different configuration files and settings specific to Sphinx and readthedocs.org.

## How do I need to configure Sphinx to generate documentation from GoogleStyle documentation?

To configure Sphinx to generate documentation from GoogleStyle docstrings, you will need to install the sphinxcontrib-napoleon extension. This extension allows Sphinx to recognize the Args, Returns, Raises, and other sections commonly used in GoogleStyle docstrings, and to format them correctly in the generated documentation.

Here are the steps to install and configure sphinxcontrib-napoleon in your Sphinx project:

1. Install the sphinxcontrib-napoleon extension using pip:

```python
pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon
```

2. Add 'sphinxcontrib.napoleon' to the extensions list in your conf.py file:

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.doctest',
    'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',
    'sphinx.ext.todo',
    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
    'sphinxcontrib.napoleon',
]
```

3. Add 'numpydoc' to the napoleon_google_docstring option in your conf.py file:

```python
napoleon_google_docstring = True
napoleon_numpy_docstring = False
```

This tells sphinxcontrib-napoleon to use the GoogleStyle conventions for the Args, Returns, Raises, and other sections, rather than the NumPy conventions.

4. Build your Sphinx documentation as usual:

```python
make html
```

This should generate documentation from your GoogleStyle docstrings using the sphinxcontrib-napoleon extension.

Note that sphinxcontrib-napoleon also supports other docstring styles, including NumPy and reStructuredText. If you have existing documentation written in another style, you may need to adjust the configuration to recognize that style. See the sphinxcontrib-napoleon documentation for more information.

## What do I need to do to use the GoogleStyle documentation processed with the "sphinxcontrib-napoleon" module to be able to read it on readthedocs.org?

To use the GoogleStyle documentation processed with the sphinxcontrib-napoleon module on readthedocs.org, you need to make sure that your requirements.txt file includes the sphinxcontrib-napoleon package, and that you have set the appropriate configuration options in your conf.py file.

Here are the steps to configure your documentation for readthedocs.org:

1. Create a requirements.txt file in the root of your project, if you haven't already done so. This file should list all the Python packages that your documentation depends on, including sphinx and sphinxcontrib-napoleon. For example:

```makefile
sphinx==4.4.0
sphinxcontrib-napoleon==0.7
```

2. Create a .readthedocs.yml file in the root of your project, if you haven't already done so. This file should specify the version of Python that you want to use, and any other settings that are specific to readthedocs.org. For example:

```yaml
version: 2

# Build documentation in the latest available Python 3.x environment
python:
  version: 3.9
  system_site_packages: false

# Build the documentation using Sphinx
build:
  image: latest
  environment:
    READTHEDOCS: True
  steps:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
```

3. In your conf.py file, make sure that you have configured sphinxcontrib-napoleon to recognize GoogleStyle docstrings, as described in the previous answer. For example:

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinxcontrib.napoleon',
]

napoleon_google_docstring = True
napoleon_numpy_docstring = False
```

4. Commit and push your changes to your repository.
5. Create a new project on readthedocs.org, and connect it to your repository.
6. Adjust any settings on readthedocs.org as necessary, such as the Python interpreter version or the build command.
7. Trigger a new build on readthedocs.org.

Once the build is complete, you should be able to view your documentation on readthedocs.org, with the GoogleStyle docstrings processed correctly using the sphinxcontrib-napoleon extension.
